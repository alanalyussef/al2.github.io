My name is Alan Al Yussef. I am a PhD candidate in econommics at the department of Applied Economics ([**APEC**](https://researchportal.vub.be/en/persons/alan-al-yussef)) at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel ([**VUB**](https://www.vub.be/en)). I research how economic circumstances shape collective behavior. 
The current focus of my research is on political preferences and voting behavior. For my research, besides tapping into the rich body of theory and methodologies economics offers, I often wander beyond the disciplinary boundaries in search of different perspectives and new insights. My oft-visited territories are sociology, politcal science and social psychology. 

In addition to my research activities, I serve as a teaching assistant for Microeconomics and Public Choice courses, and I supervise several bachelor's theses. I also oversee a research project for the course "Research Methods in Economics and Management." In these roles, I like to assign tasks to students that prompt them to explore the social, political, and cultural aspects of economics. Their enthusiasm for these questions is truly energizing.


### Research area:
Somewhere between political economy, microeconomics, political science, economic sociology
